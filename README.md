# Random Quote Generator

> This is my 5th Project for the _Frontend Developer_ Diploma Course from **OpenClassrooms**.

## The goal:

- The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each JS call
- Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments
- Have quotes of 2 types (i chose **facts** and **motivational** quotes)
- Have the user choose _how many_ he wants to be generated (between 1 and 5)
- Include a clear/quit button

###### Side note: I take no responsibility for the generated tips / outputs ;)
